# MockExpWebsite
This is my first attempt to make a mock experiment website.

It's based on the structure of Post-Doc Yi-Chia Chen's example website.
I am using her supplementary functions as well as some main functions for my JavaScript.

There's a lot of design aspects that can be fixed, which I will work on in the future.
