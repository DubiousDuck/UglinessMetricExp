                    <strong>INFORMATION SHEET for online participants</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    You are invited to participate in a research study on human
                    cognition, conducted by Hongjing Lu, PhD, of the Dept. of
                    Psychology at UCLA. You were selected as a possible
                    participant in this study because you have normal or
                    corrected vision, and are 18 years of age or older. For
                    scientific reasons, this consent form does not include
                    complete information about the study hypotheses and the
                    research questions being tested. You will be fully debriefed
                    following your participation in the research.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Purpose of Study</strong></p>
                <p>
                    The purpose of the study is to understand human perception
                    and cognition.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Procedures Involved in Study</strong></p>
                <p>
                    If you agree to participate, you may be presented with
                    images, videos, or sounds on a computer screen, and answer
                    simple questions and/or perform simple tasks by interacting
                    with a website via a keyboard or a computer mouse. You may
                    also be asked to fill out some questionnaires about your
                    personality or experience, which will take at max 15
                    minutes. Your responses will be recorded by the computer and
                    will not be identified with you in any way. You may receive
                    a demographic questionnaire to collect information of your
                    age, gender, ethnicity, and language. The session will take
                    at most 60 minutes.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Potential Risks and Discomforts</strong></p>
                <p>
                    There is no known risk/discomfort in this study. If you
                    experience any discomfort during the course of the
                    experiment, you can stop at any time and notify the
                    experimenter.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Potential Benefits to Subject</strong></p>
                <p>
                    There are no direct benefits from participating in this
                    study.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Potential Benefits to Society</strong></p>
                <p>
                    The findings of the study will help improve procedures for
                    making important decisions to avoid unwanted biases. For
                    example, individual’s cognitive tendencies may influence
                    their decision making on finance, relationships, or diets,
                    and their behaviors in different contexts like internet
                    versus in-person interactions. By understanding how people
                    differ from each other, we will be able to design better
                    environments for people to make rational and just decisions
                    in different domains in life.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Payment for Participation</strong></p>
                <p>
                    You would receive 0.5 hour of credit every 30 minute for
                    your psychology class if you signed up for the study through
                    the UCLA Psychology Department Subject Pool; otherwise, you
                    would receive the payment in the rate of $10 per hour for
                    your participation.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Confidentiality</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Your identity in this study will be treated as confidential.
                    The results of the study, including laboratory or any other
                    data, may be published for scientific purposes but will not
                    include any identifiable references to you. The researchers
                    will do their best to make sure that your private
                    information is kept confidential. Information about you will
                    be handled as confidentially as possible, but participating
                    in research may involve a loss of privacy and the potential
                    for a breach in confidentiality. Study data will be
                    physically and electronically secured. As with any use of
                    electronic means to store data, there is a risk of breach of
                    data security. Your data, including de-identified data may
                    be kept for use in future research.

                    Your IP Addresses may be collected to prevent the same IP
                    address from participating twice. Your platform ID (e.g.,
                    Mturk worker ID, Prolific ID, or Sona ID) will not be shared
                    with anyone outside of the research team and will not be
                    linked to study responses. However, any work performed on
                    MTurk can be linked to the user’s public profile page. Thus,
                    you may wish to restrict what information you choose to
                    share in your public profile.

                    We are interested in finding out what “looks bad” for
                    people. An obvious answer would be just whatever that
                    doesn't look aesthetically pleasing. However, is it possible
                    that “ugliness” serves special function that it has more
                    depth and dimension?
                </p>
                <br /><br />

                    Earlier, you shared your impressions of images regarding
                    various dimensions. With these data, we can look for
                    relationships between ugliness and various aspect of your
                    impressions. For example, if the “gross” impression is
                    highly correlated with ugliness, it may suggest that seeing
                    ugliness may be related to detecting "gross" things.

                    We are studying human cognition by looking at how people
                    differ in terms of personality, cognitive tendencies, and
                    skills. Here are a few example scientific questions we are
                    looking at:
                </p>
                <p>Do people agree what looks pretty and what looks bad?</p>
                <p>
                    How is one’s personality related to their judgement of
                    social situations?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Would cultural backgrounds influence memory of different
                    objects?
                </p>
